# SoundHX
 A Haxe port of SoundAS - [AS3 SoundManager](https://github.com/treefortress/SoundAS)

 A modern lightweight for Flash, AIR & Haxe

The goal of SoundHX is to simplifying playback of your audio files, with a focus on easily transitioning from one to another, and differentiating between SoundFX and Music Loops.

#Features

API Chaining: SoundHX.play("music").fadeTo(0);
Supports groups of sounds
Supports seamless looping
Supports workaround for the 'looping bug' (http://www.stevensacks.net/2008/08/07/as3-sound-channel-bug/)
Built-in Tweening system, no dependancies
Modular API: Use SoundInstance directly and ignore the rest.
